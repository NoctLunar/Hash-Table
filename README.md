# Hash-Table
This is old code i don't use anymore, so i hope someone finds it useful as a bases or to update and make it better for there own use case.

What this is, is just a app using dnlib to load a assembly and generate a huge hash table of the code base which you can use say on a server side to to a tamper check against the code as its running

Do note though on bigger code bases this is very unoptimized, so i would say against really using this without some changes :D
